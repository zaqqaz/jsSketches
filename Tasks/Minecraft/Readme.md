If you need some material but have another one, in some cases it's possible to receive by applying some actions on it.
So, write a function `getRequiredActions(input: string, expectedOutput: string, availableActions: Action[])`
which will return which actions should be applied.

Check the minecraft.spec.ts to get more details ;)
